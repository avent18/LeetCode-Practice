This repository is a personal collection of LeetCode problems I’ve solved, organized in a clean folder structure for easy navigation and learning. Each folder is named using the problem’s ID and title, and contains a well-commented Java solution. For selected problems, I also include .excalidraw files to visually explain the logic or approach used. The goal of this repository is not just to track my own progress, but to serve as a resource for anyone who wants to learn data structures and algorithms through practical coding problems. Whether you’re preparing for interviews, improving your coding skills, or just getting started with problem-solving, you’ll find valuable insights here. I welcome contributions from others as well—feel free to fork the repository, add your solutions, improve existing ones, or contribute visual explanations. Together, we can build a community-driven repository that helps learners at all levels grow and master DSA.
